===============================
What is Nova?
===============================

    Nova is a software application for preventing and detecting hostile Network Reconnaissance. It does this by first creating a large array of thin virtual machines on the target network. These VMs are created using an updated Honeyd to be extremely lightweight. They're not your typical VMs that you might see from VirtualBox or VMWare. They just appear to be real from the perspective of the network, and run network "services" which are just shell scripts.

    Second, Nova uses machine learning algorithms to automatically detect and classify attempts at hostile reconnaissance, so there's no need to go searching manually through your honeypot's log files.

===============================
The Installation Guide
===============================

- The first thing to note is that Nova is currently only compatible with
Linux, so if you do not have a Linux machine or a Linux partition on another
machine, I would suggest that you go download Ubuntu 10.04 or higher and install
it, either as a partition or for the whole machine. This guide will not address
any issues with installing Linux; it is concerned with the installation and
proper setup of Nova.


===============================
Getting Dependencies
===============================

- Once you have Ubuntu up and running, you must now download the libraries
required to compile Nova correctly. Make sure to watch the terminals at the
beginning of the install process, and be sure to type 'Y' when asked to do so.
Install the libraries with the following command:

    sudo apt-get install git build-essential libcap2-bin libann-dev libpcap0.8-dev libsparsehash-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-serialization-dev libnotify-dev sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev libcurl3 libcurl4-gnutls-dev iptables


- Now, we'll have to take a quick detour to get another integral component
of Nova: honeyd. We will have to download some extra libraries for honeyd as
well; you can get them using this command:

    sudo apt-get install libevent-dev libdumbnet-dev libpcap-dev libpcre3-dev libedit-dev bison flex libtool automake 

- For the Honeyd Autoconfiguration tool, we require Nmap 6.00 or higher. The current version in the apt repository is 
5.21, so you'll have to go to the Nmap website and get 6.00. It can be found here: 

    http://nmap.org/download.html

	OR

    wget http://nmap.org/dist/nmap-6.01.tar.bz2

There are instructions for manual install on the same page (but are just the standard ./configure, make, and sudo make install commands).


- NOTE: Honeyd requires libevent version 2.x. If you are running Ubuntu 10.10 or lower, the version of libevent available in the repos is only 1.x. So you will need to either find a backport or build libevent 2.x from source.

- If you wish to optionally generate Debian packages for Nova, you will also require dpkg-dev:

    sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev


===============================
Getting the newest code
===============================


Go to the directy you wish to download the code to and run the following commands,

    git clone git://github.com/DataSoft/Honeyd.git
    git clone git://github.com/DataSoft/Nova.git

This will create a "honeyd" and "Nova" folder with the source located inside. From this point on 
they will be referred to as $HONEYD_SOURCE and $NOVA_SOURCE. 

This will default to the "master" branch, which is the latest stable release. If you want to use
the latest unstable version of NOVA, cd to the $NOVA_SOURCE folder and run the following,

	git checkout integration

Beware that the integration branch changes often on a daily basis.

===============================
Building Honeyd
===============================

Change directories to the $HONEYD_SOURCE folder where all of the honeyd source code should 
be on your machine. When inside the source directory, follow the next steps to build and install.

    Step 1: ./autogen.sh
    Step 2: automake
    Step 3: ./configure
    Step 4: make
    Step 5: sudo make install


===============================
Building Nova
===============================

Change into the $NOVAD_SOURCE folder where the novad source code resides.

    cd ~/Code/Nova

To build and install run the commands,

    Step 1: make
    Step 2: sudo make install

- Note: If building fails for some reason, make sure you run 'make clean' before trying again.

- Finally, while logged in as the user you plan to run Novad with, 
run the following command to add your user to the 'nova' permission group
and to set up database tables for the web interface.

    Step 3: sudo nova_init

- Your user will have to be in the "nova" group in order for nova and honeyd to
run properly. The nova_init script will do this, but you must log in and
back out for the change to take effect.

    Step 4: Log out and log back in

- After these steps are completed without errors, Nova is set up on your
system. You'll probably want to install a GUI for nova, either the QT based or web based GUI.
Instructions for installing the GUIs follow below.

Refer to the Help tab in the GUI and the Nova wiki for more information.

===============================
 QT Interface
===============================

Getting dependencies for the QT GUI,
	sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev

The QT GUI (novagui) is a simple C++/QT interface for accessing nova and it's configuration on 
the same machine you're running it on. To build and install,
    Step 1: cd $NOVA_SOURCE
    Step 2: make novagui-release
    Step 3: make install

Launch with the command "novagui".

===============================
 Web Interface
===============================
NOVA has a web interface that can be used for a GUI instead of the QT novagui.

There is a getDependencies.sh script provided to download the required dependencies.

To install,
    Step 1: cd $NOVA_SOURCE/NovaWeb
    Step 2: sudo bash getDependencies.sh
    Step 3: sudo npm install -g forever
    Step 4: cd $NOVA_SOURCE
    Step 5: make web
    Step 6: sudo make install-web

Note that the internal web interface uses SSL. If you want to generate or use your own
SSL certificate and private key, put them in /usr/share/nova/NovaWeb/servercert.pem and
/usr/share/nova/NovaWeb/serverkey.pem after installation.

To start the web interface, run the command "novaweb" and go to https://localhost:8080 in
a web browser (default login is username "nova" and password "toor"). 
"novaweb -debug" may provide more information if there are problems. Novaweb
launches the nodejs server with the "forever" daemon so it will be restarted if it crashes. 
The command "forever list" can be useful for seeing the current status, and it can be stopped with
"forever stop index (usually 0)". See the forever documentation for more information.

===============================
Debian Packages
===============================
To generate a Debian package, simply checkout what version of the software you like (or make what changes to it that you want) and run the generateDebs script (as a normal user). 

	./generateDebs <version number>
